üíä Pharmacy Inventory Manager
üß≠ Introduction
Pharmacy Inventory Manager is a full-stack web application built with C# (.NET) and React. It helps pharmacy staff manage their medication inventory, suppliers, and restock records efficiently. The app enables authenticated users to track stock levels, recent restocks, and medications nearing expiration ‚Äî all from a streamlined dashboard.

üéØ Purpose & Motivation
Pharmacies are responsible for maintaining accurate medication inventories, ensuring proper supplier tracking, and preventing expired drugs from remaining in circulation. Many small or local pharmacies still rely on spreadsheets or paper logs to manage this data, which can lead to costly mistakes.

The Pharmacy Inventory Manager was built to:

Provide a centralized, secure inventory system

Improve visibility into supply levels and restock history

Prevent medication waste through expiration alerts

Help pharmacy staff focus on patient care rather than paperwork

üß± How Was the Application Developed?
Frontend:

React

React Router

Fetch API

Context/localStorage for token handling

Backend:

ASP.NET Core Web API

Entity Framework Core

SQL Server for persistent storage

Identity Framework for user authentication and password management

Database:

One-to-many: Users ‚Üí Medications, Suppliers, RestockLogs

Many-to-many: Medications ‚Üî Suppliers

Seed data used for testing and development

üíª How to Install & Run the Application

üßó Difficulties & Challenges Faced
EF Core Many-to-Many Configuration: Setting up a composite key and relationship for the MedicationSupplier join table required careful Fluent API configuration.

Authentication Integration: Coordinating token-based auth between the frontend and backend took time to troubleshoot, especially handling invalid sessions.

Data Relationships in Forms: Populating dropdowns with existing suppliers/medications and handling IDs cleanly in state was an early frontend hurdle.

Expiring Medication Logic: Creating a clean way to filter and sort soon-to-expire medications on the dashboard took trial and error with date logic.
